   Declarations
      num firstTest
      num secondTest
      num average
      num PASSING = 60
   output "Enter first score or 0 to quit "
   while firstTest not equal to 0
      output "Enter second score "
      input secondTest
      average = firstTest + secondTest / 2
      ouput "Average is ", average
      if average >= PASSING then
         output "Pass"
      else
         output "Fail"
      endif
      output "Enter first score or 0 to quit "
   endwhile
stop

During the while statement: 'while firstTest not equal to 0' not equal should be changed to 

while firstTest <> to 0

After the first output statement there should be a input statement to collect the "firstTest" information.

output "Enter first score or 0 to quit "
input firstTest

There should be a paranthesis around the average test equation.

while firstTest not equal to 0
      output "Enter second score "
      input secondTest
      average = (firstTest + secondTest) / 2
      ouput "Average is ", average

After the final output statement there should be another input statement. This will continue the loop.

output "Enter first score or 0 to quit "
input firstTest

With these corrections, the code should work as intended.
